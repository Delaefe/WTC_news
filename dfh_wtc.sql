I am glad I took this decision, because it means my boyfriend and I can spend more time together and we can go forward with our relationship. \r\nBut at the same time I''ve been homesick. Sometimes the feeling is strong, and sometimes I barely notice it, but it''s still there. I miss my cats, I miss the familiarity of my home town and the shops, I miss the customs, I miss my family, I miss the woods, I miss our local library... I''ve even stopped reading, although I used to read at least one book a week. \r\nCan you please suggest some books that will help me feel less homesick and more at home?\r\n\r\nDear Pining for home,\r\nWe tend to think of homesickness as a juvenile malaise, adorable in the child on her first overnight school trip and endearing, even, in the teen calling home from university with a wobble in his voice. But by the time we edge into adulthood, weâ€™re supposed to have grown out of such whimsy.\r\nIt wasnâ€™t always so. During the 19th Century, homesickness among new immigrants to America, for instance, was considered suggestive of a virtuous or sensitive nature. As Susan J Matt explains in her 2011 book, Homesickness: An American History, the word didnâ€™t become widely used until around 1750. Before then, such feelings were termed â€˜nostalgiaâ€™, which was actually deemed a medical condition.\r\nKenneth Grahameâ€™s Mole would certainly agree with that diagnosis. Just think of the scene in The Wind in the Willows when, lost in the woods on a dark December evening, he catches a whiff of Mole End, the home heâ€™s abandoned in order to live with Rat on the river bank. Its effect is instantaneous and quite overwhelming.\r\nThese days, homesickness is seen as being less about missing a physical place and more about the stress caused by a break in routine. Still, it can be a serious matter â€“ especially when it stops you from reading. Studies have shown that one good way of curing such feelings is to participate in the things you loved doing before you moved. Hopefully, our literary prescription will return you to your former bookish ways.\r\n\r\nYou donâ€™t mention where it is exactly that youâ€™ve moved from, so I canâ€™t recommend any titles that will take you back there specifically. Iâ€™m not sure quite where it is that youâ€™ve moved to, either, but thatâ€™s not going to stop me from suggesting you start with Laurie Leeâ€™s Cider With Rosie. A vivid memoir of the authorâ€™s childhood in a Cotswold village, it depicts a moment on the cusp of the modern era â€“ thereâ€™s no electricity or cars just yet, and kids are left to find their own fun. Itâ€™s a narrative so vivid, so redolent with nostalgia that to read it feels like going home, even if both the home youâ€™ve left behind and the one youâ€™ve newly arrived in are a million miles away.\r\n\r\nCreature comforts\r\nSometimes, itâ€™s comforting just to feel close to something youâ€™ve left behind. You mention that you miss, among other things, your cats. For feline-centred literature, try Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami. Kafka is the chosen name of a 15-year-old runaway, but the novel belongs equally to Nakata, an elderly man with an uncanny ability to talk to cats. How he came about his gift is a whole other story, but heâ€™s put it to good use and become a professional finder of lost cats, of whom plenty prowl through this metaphysical mind-bender of a contemporary classic. Note that itâ€™s not only Kafka who is far from home. Nakata, too, will find himself on a road trip â€“ his first. You couldnâ€™t ask for more beguiling companions as you muddle through these first few months of your own new adventure.', '2016-04-21', 4, 0, 15, 1, 'homesickness.jpg'),

Loretta, age 15, climbs out of the window to meet her boyfriend. She returns to a beating from her strict Mormon father. He places her as the â€œsister wifeâ€ of Dean Handler, a breakaway Mormon who maintains the practice of polygamy. (Dean and his stern wife Ruth have seven children and a thriving food supply business.) But Loretta wonâ€™t be harnessed so easily. Vestal combines gorgeous writing, adventurous plotting, carefully carved characters and a series of monologues by motorcycle stuntman Evel Knievel with a deeply textured sense of the West, with its religious cults and casino wildness. Daredevils is a feat, the literary equivalent of jumping the Snake River Canyon. (Credit: Penguin Press)\r\n\r\nKathryn Harrison, True Crimes\r\nWith courage, meticulous craft and compelling candour, the novelist and essayist returns to subjects she has explored before: her childhood in Los Angeles, where grandparents stood in for her teenager mother and banished father and her later incestuous encounters with her father. She also writes movingly of her healing emotional connection with her father-in-law, her illnesses (the sudden onset of an alarming thyroid condition, her ongoing vigilance after an early melanoma is removed), and of pilgrimages in search of answers to such questions as â€œWhat did it feel like to be my mother?â€ She writes lovingly and honestly of her husband and their conflicts, and of how hard she is working to be a good mother to her three children. These intricately interwoven personal essays combine into a tapestry of rare beauty.

Itâ€™s four months before reunification, and they are passengers on two Vespas, on their way to a rave. â€œI feel like Iâ€™m in Felliniâ€™s Roma,â€ he writes. They dance until dawn under the Wall, in an old U-Bahn station closed for 40 years. â€œI am nowhere,â€ he writes. â€œI am home.â€ And indeed he is. Spillman was born in Berlin, the son of American classical musicians who separated when he was four. As he retraces his steps, Spillman evokes decades of cultural life in West Berlin and the US, and traces the satisfactions of his love and marriage. This young artistâ€™s cross-cultural coming-of-age comes complete with a mixtape featuring Beethoven, Sonic Youth, Satie and the Sex Pistols.

Bela is distraught because her own daughter Tara is dropping out of college. Can Sabitri help? â€œWhat is it about children?â€ Divakaruni writes. â€œAn old need twisted in Sabitriâ€™s chest. Protect, protect.â€ She begins a letter to Tara, whom she has never met, telling her own cautionary tale.

George Leonidas Leslie, the greatest burglar of the 19th Century, used his training as an architect to inaugurate â€œone of the most spacially astonishing crime sprees in US history.â€ Leslie and his gang, dressed in opera costumes, were behind 80 percent of all bank robberies in the US, including the 1878 Manhattan Savings Institution heist of $3 million. Manaugh explains how Los Angeles, known in the 1990s as the â€œbank robbery capital of the world,â€ catalysed a new kind of crime, â€œstop-and-robs,â€ because free-standing banks and credit unions were built in close proximity to the ever-expanding freeway network, and how $50 million in diamonds were stolen in Antwerp in 2003. His is a surprising and fascinating true-crime epic. (Credit: Farrar, Straus and Giroux)', '2016-04-21', 4, 0, 31, 2, 'books.jpg'),
(24, 'delafuente', 'Is Nordic humour too dark for the rest of the world?', 'Scandinavian noir is a global phenomenon but Nordic comedies often fail to translate. Emma Jones finds out why.', 'Two brothers havenâ€™t spoken in forty years, and a plague threatens to destroy whatâ€™s dearest to them â€“ their prize-winning herd of sheep. Thereâ€™s blood, there are tears, and itâ€™s all set against a brooding grey landscape.\r\nBut Hrutar, or Rams, isnâ€™t the latest success story of Nordic noir â€“ although itâ€™s from Iceland. Itâ€™s a tragi-comedy, which its director, GrÃ­mur HÃ¡konarson, calls â€œsad and funny at the same time. We call it â€˜gÃ¡lgahÃºmorâ€™ in Iceland, or â€˜gallows humourâ€™. Itâ€™s very typical of Scandinavia.â€\r\n\r\nRams is on course to become one of the most critically successful Nordic films ever â€“ after winning the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes, from next month it will be released in more than forty countries, including the US, UK, France and Italy. Itâ€™s also Icelandâ€™s Oscar entry.\r\n\r\nBut this is where Rams stands alone in its field â€“ bleating. While Swedish producer Gudrun Giddings, who lives in Los Angeles, says her phone has been â€œringing off the hookâ€ since 2010 with requests for Nordic talent, the woman known as â€˜the Scandinavian Whispererâ€™ for her ability to promote these countries in Hollywood, says when it comes to comedy, her sweet nothings fall on deaf ears.\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re known for being dark and depressing,â€ she says. â€œI suppose our comedy can be seen like that too.â€\r\n\r\nPitch black\r\n\r\nThe global phenomenon of â€˜Nordic Noirâ€™ started with the Swedish original of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in 2009, which sold six million cinema tickets. It was followed by Wallander, The Killing, The Bridge and political thriller Borgen.\r\nHollywood capitalised on Swedish vampire horror Let the Right One In by remaking it as Let Me In, while even the family film Frozen is based on an old Scandinavian myth. Next tip for the top is Occupied, which debuted on Norwayâ€™s TV2 recently and is about the fictional Russian occupation of the country.\r\n\r\nStockholm-based Yellowbird productions is behind it, as well as Wallander and Dragon Tattoo, but even its Chief Creative Officer, Berna Levin, describes the comedic genre as â€œone tough nut to crack.â€\r\nâ€œItâ€™s the one area we just canâ€™t develop,â€ she says. â€œWeâ€™re constantly in demand for drama because weâ€™re seen as edgy, twisted and a little rebellious, but weâ€™re finding it so difficult to sell comedy that I canâ€™t see us doing anything for an international market for the foreseeable future.', '2016-04-21', 4, 0, 25, 1, 'nordics.jpg'),
(25, 'delafuente', 'Vinyl: What was the sound really defined the ''70s?', 'The TV programme Vinyl reinforces a vision of 1970s music history thatâ€™s flattering to fans of ''dad rock'' but which ignores diversity, writes Owen Gleiberman.', 'More than perhaps any other era, the 1970s had a way of producing pop songs that got little to no respect at the time but that are now regarded as irresistible classics. Songs like Abbaâ€™s Dancing Queen, ELOâ€™s Canâ€™t Get It Out of My Head, Stealers Wheelâ€™s Stuck in the Middle with You, or even a ditty like the Partridge Familyâ€™s I Woke Up in Love This Morning were once the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. But now they tend to hit our ears like pure gold. Whatâ€™s changed? It may simply be that these songs, and others like them, were always beloved, but that a certain critical snobbery that was once in the air has now mercifully melted away. Finally, we can just admit it: when it comes to â€˜70s pop, weâ€™re all hooked on a feeling.\r\n\r\nPart of the attraction of Vinyl, the HBO drama that resembles a down-and-dirty, cocaine-fueled Mad Men set inside a New York record company, is that for most of its first season, it has been working overtime to conjure an authentic image of the early-â€˜70s music world â€“ when kitsch rubbed up against quality and it was often hard to tell the difference. But while Vinyl has proved to be a surprisingly addictive examination of shabby but complicated male behaviour â€“ â€˜men acting badlyâ€™ being a genre unto itself on TV since The Sopranos â€“ it has also missed its biggest opportunity. Much as Iâ€™ve enjoyed it, the showâ€™s main flaw is that even as it takes pains to name-check almost every fabled rock star of the period, from Bowie to Springsteen to Led Zeppelin to Lou Reed to Donny Osmond to Elvis, its musical vision is consistently a little nuts â€“ a myopic puristâ€™s dream of what rock & roll should be, rather than what it was.\r\n\r\nRichie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale), the showâ€™s brooding and self-destructive but cuddly hero, has got a problem: heâ€™s working to save his record company in 1973, and he appears to know absolutely nothing about what it takes to run a record company in 1973. The crazy thing is, the series doesnâ€™t seem to know how little he knows either.\r\n\r\nAt a glance, Richieâ€™s troubles might seem related to the fact that he snorts coke by the pound, is a possible murder suspect, or that his marriage to a glamorous refugee from Andy Warholâ€™s entourage (Olivia Wilde) is hitting the skids. But no: this is all presented as routine ''70s insanity. Richieâ€™s real problem is the quality the show salutes him for in every episode: his fearless quest to relight the fire of rock & roll â€“ to retrofit that pulse and ecstasy and drive to a new era. He locates that spirit in The Nasty Bits, a discordant quartet of ruffians who remind him of the MC5.\r\n\r\nAt first, he turns over The Nasty Bits to one of his A&R gurus, an old-school taskmaster, who grooms and tames them by teaching them how to play You Really Got Me. But that turns out to be appalling to Richie â€“ a toning down of their appeal. Really? Even the Sex Pistols covered (Iâ€™m Not Your) Steppinâ€™ Stone. So Richie returns them to their old, sloppy, quasi-tuneless selves and hands the grooming over to Jamie (Juno Temple), the showâ€™s hippie version of Peggy Olsen, which sits just fine with the lead singer, Kip (James Jagger), a junkie wastrel who is not much of a vocalist, but who knows how to play his wide-mouthed sneer with impeccable slouchy attitude. All of which leaves us wondering how, exactly, the band is going to save Richieâ€™s company.\r\nTunnel vision\r\nIf this were 1977, we might not have to wonder. The birth of punk is certainly a vital subject for a long-form television drama. And in an odd way, that seems to be the story that Vinyl most wants to tell. The Nasty Bits are supposed to be the early spirit of punk , a bridge between the anarchy of the MC5 and the ritualised mayhem of the CBGB era. But itâ€™s worth noting that just as Abba rarely got credit during the â€˜70s for being the genius tunesmiths they were, neither did the formative punk band of the era: The Ramones. The myth that gathered around them â€“ that they could barely play their instruments, that it was all â€˜attitude,â€™ â€“ remains largely intact. Even though thereâ€™s almost no truth to it. The Ramones werenâ€™t primitive noise-mongers â€“ they were technically astonishing musicians who played sublimely catchy pop songs at death-defying speeds. The Nasty Bits, on the other hand, do not appear to have a tune like Sheena Is a Punk Rocker in them, and even that song didnâ€™t sell. Not even in 1978. And so again, the question: what is Richie doing? \r\n\r\nActually, what heâ€™s doing, for the entire season, is ignoring everything that was exciting about 1973 â€“ like, for instance, the debut albums of Steely Dan, Abba, or the newly retooled version of The Spinners, who under producer Thom Bell began their reign as the most celestial soul ensemble of the â€˜70s. Not to mention the first two albums released by Bruce Springsteen. Or the release of the song that launched disco into the stratosphere, the Oâ€™Jayâ€™sâ€™ Love Train. But the problem is that some now feel none of that stuff is cool. It lacks the lo-fi hipster rock cred that the creators of Vinyl fetishise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2016-04-21', 4, 0, 56, 1, 'vynil.jpg'),
(26, 'delafuente', 'White House: Obama ''cleared the air'' with Saudi Arabia', 'The two countries are bound by military links and a shared fight against terrorism', 'The White House moved to tamp down suggestions that ties with Saudi Arabia are fraying, with administration officials saying that President Barack Obama "really cleared the air" with King Salman at a meeting Wednesday.\r\n\r\nYet even as White House officials stressed that the leaders made progress, a prominent member of the Saudi royal family told CNN "a recalibration" of the U.S.-Saudi relationship was needed amid regional upheaval, dropping oil prices and ongoing strains between the two longtime allies.\r\n\r\nObama landed in Riyadh earlier Wednesday for a summit with Gulf leaders and spent two-and-a-half hours meeting with the 80-year-old monarch on issues that have recently strained the alliance, including the conflict in Yemen, the role of Iran, Lebanon''s instability and the fight against ISIS, U.S. officials said.\r\n\r\nStatements after the meeting made clear that deep differences remain on several of these points, with the two sides agreeing to disagree and a U.S. official characterizing the encounter as the start of a discussion rather than a venue for solutions.\r\nBut the two leaders glossed over some of the thorniest matters, including a Saudi threat to dump U.S. assets if Obama signs into law a bill that could make the kingdom liable for damages stemming from the September 11 terror attacks.\r\n\r\nThere is going to have to be "a recalibration of our relationship with America," former Saudi Intelligence Chief Prince Turki Al-Faisal told CNN''s Christiane Amanpour. "How far we can go with our dependence on America, how much can we rely on steadfastness from American leadership, what is it that makes for our joint benefits to come together," Turki said in a significant departure from usual Saudi rhetoric. "These are things that we have to recalibrate."\r\n\r\nAn unhappy marriage\r\nFor all the crosscurrents buffetting U.S.-Saudi relations, analysts and former officials say the two countries aren''t at the end of a love affair so much as in an unhappy marriage in which both sides, for better or worse, are stuck with each other.\r\n"Despite all these differences, Saudi Arabia and America are not getting divorced," said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution and a former CIA official. "We need each other."\r\nIt''s tough going, though. The Saudis have little confidence in Obama''s commitment to their security and fear he''s shifting U.S. attentions to its rival, Iran; Obama has described the Saudis as "so-called allies" and has complained their policies fuel anti-U.S. terror and regional chaos.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S. Congress, a growing drumbeat of criticism about Saudi Arabia is finding expression in efforts to restrict arms sales to Riyadh, expose alleged Saudi involvement in the September 11 terror attacks and allow it to be sued for that day''s destruction and death.\r\n\r\nThe clamor coincides with increasing domestic energy resources that lessen the U.S. need for foreign oil. Moreover, the allies are divided by a slew of issues including the approach to the wars in Syria and Yemen, the Iranian nuclear deal and the influence Tehran wields in Iraq.\r\n\r\nThese regional issues are topping Obama''s agenda during his visit this week as he looks for backing for the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. And they are dynamics that are set to persist and color the U.S.-Saudi relationship for the next occupant of the Oval Office as well. Turki told CNN that the changes underway will last long after Obama leaves office.\r\n"I don''t think that we should expect any new president in America to go back to, as I said, the yesteryear days when things were different," Turki said.\r\n\r\nA chilly welcome\r\nThe prince made his unprecedented comments as Obama landed in Riyadh to a reception that social media critics termed a snub, but U.S. officials strongly disputed. The Saudi government dispatched the governor of Riyadh and Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubair to shake Obama''s hand, a departure from the scene at the airport earlier in the day when King Salman was shown on state television greeting the leaders of other Gulf nations on the tarmac.\r\n\r\nA U.S. official said Salman''s absence upon arrival was not taken as a snub and noted that Obama rarely greets foreign leaders when they land in the U.S. for meetings. Obama went immediately to the Erga Palace to meet the King shortly after landing, but the perceived slight on his arrival was seen as one more sign that a relationship long lubricated by barrels of oil is encountering friction.\r\nFawaz Gerges, an expert on Islamic-Western relations at the London School of Economics, called their current dynamic "an estrangement" but not a break that would end U.S. involvement in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nHe''s among many analysts who say that, as unlikely as the union between a rigidly conservative Islamic monarchy with a questionable human rights record and a secular democratic republic may seem, neither will be able to cut the ties the bind them.\r\nThe two countries are connected by military links and sales, a shared fight against terrorism, the need to leverage each other''s diplomatic clout and, for the U.S., the necessity of ensuring that world oil supplies flow freely.

Both Trump and Clinton have fought bitterly for months to keep their rivals at bay, each slogging through primary contests that exposed vulnerabilities in their candidacies and campaigns.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Trump came close to sweeping New York''s 95 delegates -- a development that could help the Manhattan real estate mogul win the GOP nomination outright and avoid what would be an explosive and messy contested convention in July. Clinton''s win, meanwhile, will go a long way in blunting the momentum of Bernie Sanders -- the liberal Vermont senator whose unexpected popularity has dogged the former secretary of state.\r\nAs of 12 a.m. ET, Trump held 847 delegates, while Ted Cruz had 553 and John Kasich had 148, according to CNN estimate. A Republican candidate needs 1,237 delegates to clinch the nomination.\r\nAcross the aisle, Clinton was leading with 1,930 delegates including 1,443 pledged delegates and 487 superdelegates.

"We''re going to go into the convention I think as the winner."\r\nHis remarks suggested he may take a less harsh tone against his GOP competitors in the weeks ahead.

(32, 'delafuente', 'How the financial crisis made Europe stronger.', 'Five key responses combined to steer Europe out of the crisis.', 'Europe is back in the game. Having suffered the worst financial and economic crisis of the last 80 years, Europe took decisive action to improve its public finances, push through deep reforms, and establish new institutions to manage and prevent crises better. The changes are structural, long-lasting and make Europe more competitive. Europe is stronger, better equipped and in the midst of ambitious new financial and economic initiatives.\r\n\r\nEurope is stronger than you think\r\n\r\nThe global crisis hit Europe twice. The first strike came from abroad in 2007. In the United States, markets had ignored credit risk in subprime mortgage markets. A lack of financial supervision allowed opaque financial instruments to flourish, aggravating the problem. As a result, the U.S. banking system underwent a dramatic bail-out in September 2008. European banks suffered in the fallout. Two years later, a second crisis erupted in the euro area. Years of unsustainable government policies had caused deficits and debt burdens to mushroom and bloated pre-crisis wages and housing prices. As the situation worsened, Europe took courageous decisions to put the continent back on firm footing.\r\n\r\nFirst, crisis-hit countries like Ireland and Spain pushed through badly needed reforms, improving public finances and increasing competitiveness.\r\n\r\nSecond, EU economic governance was strengthened. The European Commission received new powers to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, issue country-specific recommendations (the ''European semester''), and underline obstacles that need to be removed to foster growth. Eurostat, Europe''s statistical agency, became more powerful in cross-checking and challenging the data received from each country.\r\n\r\nThird, euro area countries created the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), and its predecessor the European Financial Stability Facility. These institutions were a great success: no country was forced to leave the euro area, the cash-for-reform approach worked, and growth accelerated in countries that implemented reforms. Importantly, no European taxpayer money was spent on the rescue programmes. The ESM raises the funds needed in capital markets through highly-rated bonds, and passes on the low funding cost to programme countries at rates today of around 1-2%. This approach produces budget savings for programme countries, particularly Greece, which would pay much more if it were to tap capital markets independently.\r\n\r\nFourth, the European Central Bank''s unconventional measures helped. The ECB expanded its balance sheet like the FED, Bank of Japan and Bank of England, provided unlimited liquidity for banks, started a bond purchasing programme to avoid low inflation, which also made it easier for banks to lend and boost investor sentiment. The euro weakened which helped to increase exports.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Banking Union was established: new institutions were created to monitor macro-prudential risks and supervise banks, securities markets and insurance companies. The Single Supervisory Mechanism is the centrepiece of this initiative; it oversees the 130 largest euro area banks. During the crisis, EU banks also padded out their capital, increasing their capital base by â‚¬600 billion since 2008.\r\n\r\nAnd the results?\r\n\r\nThe results are impressive. The crisis-hit countries implemented radical reforms. They now head multiple international rankings, earning the sobriquet ''reform champions''. Many of Europe''s crisis countries â€“ Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain â€“ ended up in the top five of 34 OECD members (a club for the most developed countries) in recognition of their structural reforms. They did so by improving their public finances, reducing deficits, and cutting labour costs to make themselves more competitive. The euro area outperformed the US, Japan and the UK in fiscal terms: the aggregate euro area budget deficit was significantly smaller than these three peers. And finally, some of the crisis countries are becoming growth leaders. In 2015, Ireland hit a record high 6.9% GDP growth and Spain 3.2%. Ireland''s growth matched China''s, while Spain''s is almost a third again as high as the US''s (2.5%) over the same period. These are extraordinary achievements.\r\n\r\nThree big initiatives to shape Europe''s economic future\r\n\r\nDuring the crisis, Europe picked up the pace of policy reform and integration with three big initiatives that merit close attention. They will set the economic and financial agenda for the next five to 10 years and will be key to Europe''s economic future.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the Banking Union\r\n\r\nEurope''s Banking Union is moving forward. On 1 January 2016, the new European mechanism to resolve failing banks went live. The Single Resolution Mechanism''s (SRM) goal is to resolve distressed banks at the lowest cost to taxpayers. It includes the participation of the private sector, such as shareholders, junior and senior creditors and unsecured and very large depositors, according to the bail-in rules under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). Additionally, SRM-covered banks will most likely need to provide â‚¬55 billion in funding over the next eight years to create the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). While this means higher costs for banks, it reduces the need for taxpayers to cover bank failures.\r\n\r\nThe final step to completing the Banking Union is a common deposit guarantee scheme similar to the US''s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This year, a European Commission proposal to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) has been hotly debated. The aim is to guarantee individual deposits of up to â‚¬100,000 at all banks in the euro area â€“ benefiting around 340 million citizens in 19 countries. It is far from a done deal, but if agreed and implemented, the US and Europe will share a similar approach to supervision, stress testing, resolution, and deposit guarantees.\r\nA deeper Capital Markets Union\r\n\r\nWith the Banking Union advancing at high speed, Europe launched another big project last year: the Capital Markets Union (CMU). The CMU''s goal is to create deeper and more integrated capital markets. Traditionally, Europe has been dominated by bank financing: when an entrepreneur needed funding, banks were the go-to partner. During the crisis, banks tried to reduce their risk exposure and, as a result, financing for entrepreneurs, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and some corporations, dried up. The CMU aims to address this issue.\r\n\r\nThe differences on the two sides of the Atlantic are large. Banking Union bank assets total â‚¬30.2 trillion compared to just $13.4 trillion in the US, a gap explained by the source of financing. Euro area banking credit reaches some 170% of GDP, against only 45% of GDP in the US. Stock market capitalisation and debt securities are respectively some 45% and 10% of GDP in the euro area compared to 110% and 45% in the US.\r\n', '2016-04-21', 2, 1, 35, 10, 'europecrisis.jpg'),
