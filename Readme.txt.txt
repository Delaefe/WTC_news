What's The Craic? News

Dimas de la Fuente Hernandez

WTC News is a website where you can find many kind of news. 
We have space for General, Economy, Science & Technology, Culture and Sports! 

In our website, the contents are made by our users, so every registered user is free to send his/her articles. 
Besides that, they can rate other articles using the 'like' button. 
This allows the users to sort the articles by most popular or most viewed. 

Also, we provide to our users the opportunity to express their opinion by commenting in every article. 
But be careful! Because other users can vote your comment, and our adminds are watching you...	

This website has been made using HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, jQuery and some AJAX for few functionalities.
Stiling the website has been a long job. I tried to make it easy to read for the user, using black, blue and grey/white colours.

The actions have not been the hardest job, despite of actions such as liking articles and the management functions for the
admins, where AJAX has been used to avoid refreshing the page.

Finally, I wanted to add some extra features, but I was running out of time due to I had some liabilities in Spain.
So, I could not finish them properly. I wanted to add the option for the users to rate comments positively and negatively, 
provide the posibility to upload/send articles with an image and store it in the database and, finally, hash the passwords
of every user to provide more security to the database.

Instead of hashing passwords, I put a required pattern so that when a user is filling the form, his/her passwords must have
uppercase, lowercase, special char and a number, with a minimum of 8 characters.
